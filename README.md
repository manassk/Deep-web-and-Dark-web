# _**DEEP WEB AND DARK WEB**_

**DEEP WEB**

**The deepweb** is a part of world wide web where its contents are restricted and they are hidden in http form. It includes pages which are not indexed, private databases etc They are not accessible by the general public. It includes online banking, mails and other restricted pages. The contents of these are accessed through direct URLs or through IP addresses to access some passwords. Deep webs can record our details so we cannot be anonymous. Deep webs are difficult to access but we can access it due to system vulnerabilities. The deep web gives far more access to users than surface web.

**DARK NET**

**A dark net** is an overlay network which is can only be accessed by specific software, configurations or authorization and also uses a customized and unique communication protocol. Social networks and anonymity proxy networks such as torare the two typical dark net types which is an anonymized series of connections.

**DARK WEB**

**The dark web** is a part of deep web where the contents are not restricted and the user remains anonymous. It includes sites which are not available on normal search engines. Search engines like TOR browsers are required to access dark web. The dark web websites are hidden so we require the exact URL to access it different dark websites. We can find the directory to different dark websites using a search engine called Hidden Wikki. In that we can find a lots of directories which will redirect to the pages which contain a lots of content like child pornography, selling credit and debit card, Drug stores, Illegal medicines, and so on. As I&#39;ve seen when we search for assassination we can find a website where we can contact with the assassin and give details about the victim.The dark web is the market of Drug dealings, assassin hiring and other illegal activities. It can also be harmful for the users as most of the hackers use dark web for their activities. If the user downloads or clicks on anything wrong then their systems can be easily hacked by the hackers and they can even attack with their virus. Even though it is anonymous, if the user uses credit card for the payment then their details can be accessed. So in that case we have to use cryptocurrencies. The dark web is used by military, government and law enforcement agencies because of its anonymity so that they can conduct their operations successfully without revealing their identities. The dark web contains 95% of the internet.
